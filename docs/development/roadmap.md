> **Version**: 2026.3.11 | **Last Updated**: 2026-03-11
> **Status**: Phases 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7A, 7B complete — Phase 6 next

## Vision

Shruti MVP v1 is a functional DAW capable of recording, editing, mixing, and exporting audio with plugin support. It should be usable for real music production, not just a tech demo. Purpose-built as the primary audio workstation for the AGNOS ecosystem.

---

## Phase 1: Foundation (Complete)

**Goal:** Audio plays through the system reliably.

- [x] Workspace setup — Cargo workspace with 6 crates (engine, dsp, plugin, ui, session, ai)
- [x] Platform audio backends — ALSA, PipeWire, JACK, CoreAudio, WASAPI via cpal abstraction
- [x] Audio graph — Lock-free node graph with topological execution plan
- [x] Basic buffer management — `AudioBuffer` with interleaved storage, per-channel access
- [x] Audio file I/O — WAV/FLAC/ADPCM read (symphonia), WAV write (hound)
- [x] CLI playback tool — `shruti-play` headless playback binary

**Exit criteria:** Can play back and record a WAV file on all three platforms with <10ms latency.

---

## Phase 2: Session & Tracks (Complete)

**Goal:** Multi-track timeline with non-destructive editing.

- [x] Session/project model — `Session` with SQLite persistence + sidecar audio pool
- [x] Track types — Audio tracks, bus tracks, master bus (`TrackKind` enum)
- [x] Timeline — Region-based, non-destructive clip arrangement with fade in/out
- [x] Basic editing — Split, move, trim, fade via `EditCommand` enum + undo integration
- [x] Transport — Play, pause, stop, loop, seek, tempo/time signature, BPM↔frame conversions
- [x] Undo/redo — Command-pattern undo/redo with full history (`UndoManager`, 1000 deep)

**Exit criteria:** Can arrange a multi-track session, edit regions, and play it back seamlessly.

---

## Phase 3: Mixing (Complete)

**Goal:** Professional signal routing and built-in effects.

- [x] Mixer — Per-track gain, pan, mute, solo with stereo balance panning in timeline
- [x] Sends & returns — `Send` struct with pre/post-fader routing to bus tracks
- [x] Built-in DSP — `ParametricEq` (biquad, multi-band), `Compressor`, `Reverb` (Freeverb), `Delay` (stereo), `Limiter` (brickwall), `StereoPanner`
- [x] Metering — `Meter` with peak, RMS, integrated LUFS (EBU R128 gating)
- [x] Automation — `AutomationLane` with points, Linear/Step/SCurve interpolation, per-frame value lookup

**Exit criteria:** Can produce a mixed-down track with EQ, compression, reverb, and automation.

---

## Phase 4: Plugin Hosting (Complete)

**Goal:** Load and use third-party audio plugins.

- [x] Plugin abstraction — `PluginInstance` trait with unified API across formats
- [x] CLAP host — Load CLAP plugins via `clap_entry`, parameter control
- [x] VST3 host — Load VST3 bundles via `GetPluginFactory`, platform-aware binary discovery
- [x] Native Rust plugins — Shruti-native plugin API via `shruti_plugin_create`
- [x] Plugin scanner — Scan standard paths on Linux/macOS/Windows for all formats
- [x] Plugin state — Serializable `PluginState` with params + opaque chunk data
- [x] Plugin graph node — `PluginNode` integrates any plugin into the audio graph
- [ ] Plugin UI — Embed plugin GUIs (deferred to Phase 5)
- [ ] Sandboxing — Process-isolated hosting (deferred to Phase 6)

**Exit criteria:** Can scan, load, and process audio through CLAP/VST3/Native plugins with parameter control and state save/restore.

---

## Phase 5: UI (Complete)

**Goal:** GPU-accelerated interface for the full DAW workflow.

- [x] Rendering backend — egui + eframe with wgpu + winit (GPU-accelerated immediate mode)
- [x] Arrangement view — Timeline with tracks, region clips, waveform rendering, grid lines, playhead
- [x] Mixer view — Channel strips with fader, meter, pan knob, M/S buttons, dB readout
- [x] Transport bar — Play/stop/record buttons, time display, BPM drag, loop toggle
- [x] Browser — Toggleable bottom panel with Files (rfd import) and Plugins (search filter) tabs
- [x] Keyboard shortcuts — Configurable `ShortcutRegistry` with 25+ default keybindings
- [x] Theming — JSON-serializable `ThemeColors` (28 colors), load/save, `apply_theme()` styling
- [x] Custom widgets — Fader, LevelMeter, Knob, WaveformPeaks, TrackHeader, TimelineRuler, RegionClip, AutomationLane, PluginSlot
- [x] Scroll & zoom — Ctrl+scroll zoom, shift/trackpad horizontal scroll
- [ ] Plugin UI — Embed plugin GUIs (deferred to Phase 6)

**Exit criteria:** Full DAW workflow achievable through the GUI without CLI fallback.

---

## Phase 6: Export & Polish

**Goal:** Production-ready output and workflow refinements.

- [ ] Export — Bounce to WAV, FLAC, MP3, OGG with format options
- [ ] MIDI — Basic MIDI track support (record, edit, route to plugins)
- [ ] Drag and drop — File import via drag and drop
- [ ] Preferences — Audio device selection, buffer size, sample rate config
- [ ] Error handling — Graceful recovery from plugin crashes, xruns
- [ ] Documentation — User guide, keyboard shortcut reference

**Exit criteria:** Can produce and export a finished track. Ready for real-world use.

---

## Phase 7: AGNOS Integration

**Goal:** First-class AI agent support on AGNOS. Shruti becomes a native AGNOS
application with agent-driven music production, MCP tool access, and deep
integration with daimon, hoosh, and agnoshi.
